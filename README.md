# üåç Global Terrorism Data Analysis

This project explores patterns, trends, and insights from the **Global Terrorism Database (GTD)** using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques. The goal is to understand the evolution and impact of terrorism globally over time through data-driven storytelling.

## üìä Project Overview

The Global Terrorism Database contains information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through recent years, covering over 180,000 incidents.

This analysis focuses on:
- Year-wise trends in terrorism
- Geographical distribution of attacks
- Most active terrorist groups
- Common attack types and targets
- Casualty analysis (killed/injured)
- Weapons and tactics used

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook

## üìÅ Dataset

- **Source:** [Global Terrorism Database (GTD)](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/)
- **Format:** CSV
- **Size:** ~180,000 rows, 135+ columns

## üìå Key Insights

- Terrorism has significantly increased post-2000, with a sharp rise around 2014.
- The Middle East & North Africa and South Asia are among the most affected regions.
- Groups like ISIS, Taliban, and Boko Haram are major contributors to global incidents in recent years.
- Bombings and armed assaults are the most common forms of attack.

## üí° Insights & Interpretations

- **Emergence of Terrorist Groups**: Most groups arise from war aftermaths, political instability, socio-economic disparities, and foreign interventions.

- **Regional Impact**:
  - The **Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia** remain the most affected due to prolonged conflicts.
  - **Central Asia** reports minimal activity, likely due to geographic isolation and strong authoritarian regimes.
  - **First-world countries** record little to no terrorist activity, highlighting the role of socio-economic stability.

- **Tactics & Targets**: Bombings are the most common form of attack, often used for maximum intimidation and impact. Weapon availability varies by region.

- **Unknown Variables**: Many incidents involve unknown perpetrators and locations, especially in conflict zones where reporting is difficult.

- **Changing Patterns**: Terrorism evolves with geopolitical shifts and technological advancement, requiring dynamic counter-strategies.

- **Root Causes**: Addressing poverty, political grievances, and ideological extremism is key to long-term prevention.

- **Foreign Influence**: External interference often worsens domestic issues, as seen in Iraq and other regions.

- **Recovery Examples**:
  - **Colombia**, **Sri Lanka**, and **Northern Ireland** have shown that peace-building, governance, and reconciliation can overcome terrorism.

- **Ongoing Struggles**: Countries like **Afghanistan**, **Syria**, **Somalia**, **Nigeria**, and **Yemen** continue to face high levels of terrorism due to unresolved conflicts and insurgencies.
